The Kadalu team is happy to announce a new version of Kadalu Storage,
0.6.0.

## New Features

* Support for Replica 2 - The Kadalu team hosts a tie-breaker node that
  enables users to create Replica 2 volumes with confidence. The use
  of the Tie-breaker node is to avoid Split-brain. This enhancement
  uses GlusterFS Thin arbiter feature ([Issue #37](https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/issues/37)).
* Enhancements have been added to the CSI provisioner to choose
  available storages randomly to avoid retrying with the same storage
  pool if that is down. This method also helps to utilize all the
  available storage pool for PVs ([PR #189](https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/pull/189)).
* Kadalu base container image upgraded to Fedora 31 and Gluster
  version in server and CSI container images to 7.3 ([PR #198](https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/pull/198))

## Important bug fixes

* Fixed showing the wrong state for Storage pods - In the last
  release, the new init process(shell script) introduced in the Server
  pods to handle the termination gracefully. But the new init process
  masked the failures of the Server process. Due to this, the status
  was "Running" always, even if there were failures ([PR #192](https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/pull/192)).
* Fixed Gluster remount failure, when connectivity with storage pods
  goes down, and `df` command doesn't show the Gluster mount ([PR #192](https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/pull/192)).
* Fixed permissions issue if app pods try to use mounted Kadalu PVs
  with a non-root user ([Issue #187](https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/issues/187)).
* Fixed issue in kubectl kadalu plugin while parsing arguments related
  to external storage and Tiebreaker node ([Issue #199](https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/issues/199)).

See the detailed [release
notes](https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for
additional information.

## Kadalu Storage for non-Kubernetes use cases

Kadalu team is actively working on creating the opinionated storage
solution based on GlusterFS, and the new solution aims to improve the
user experience by providing modern methods to manage the Storage
cluster.

The [new RFC](https://github.com/kadalu/rfcs/pull/14) for an external
control plane enables existing users on Gluster to view a clean
separation between the data layer and the control plane. We see this
as an efficient way to deploy Kadalu storage and gain from the
improvements in design.

Please provide your valuable inputs for the RFC.

## Replica 2 support for general purpose

Kadalu Team will work on extending Replica 2 support for general
purpose using the thin arbiter feature of GlusterFS. Follow the steps
mentioned in the below tweet to setup the Kadalu Tiebreaker container
yourself.

## New Distributed Test framework - Binnacle

[Binnacle
RFC](https://kadalu.io/rfcs/0002-test-framework-binnacle.html) was
accepted, and initial feature
[patches](https://github.com/kadalu/binnacle) landed in the
repository. This framework focusses on the Tester's delight than the
technology to write tests. More details about this framework are
available in the RFC.
