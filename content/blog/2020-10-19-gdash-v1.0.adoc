At https://kadalu.io[Kadalu.io], we reviewed the existing projects around https://gluster.org[GlusterFS] and identified a few projects which can help the users to manage/monitor GlusterFS clusters. https://github.com/kadalu/gdash[Gdash] is one such project that provides a lightweight solution to monitor the GlusterFS. This project is now moved from my repo to https://github.com/kadalu[Github/Kadalu] organization.

Read https://aravindavk.in/blog/introducing-gdash/[this blog] for the initial announcement of this project.

This release got a nice UI upgrade and a few more features. Highlights of the new features are:

* Gdash now uses glustercli Python bindings from the project https://github.com/gluster/glustercli-python[gluster/glustercli-python]
* The improved User interface.
* The earlier version used the `--remote-host` option to execute volume info and status commands. But this option only allowed on a few read-only commands. This version of gdash runs within the Cluster, which means run it on any one node of the Cluster.
* One of the issues with GlusterFS CLI is hostname is shown as localhost in the node where the command is executed(`gluster pool list`). Gdash adds a hostname argument so that it replaces the localhost with the provided hostname.
* Login is supported, and it is very easy to configure.
