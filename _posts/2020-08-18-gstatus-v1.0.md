gstatus is a command line tool which aggregates the various status information about GlusterFS cluster and presents the data in pretty printed format on the console. Output can be printed in JSON format as well with the ```-o json``` option.

## New in gstatus 1.0

* Python3 port (Now supports only Python3)
* Supports all volume types (earlier versions displayed wrong volume sizes for arbiter and disperse volumes)
* Adds quota and snapshot information.
* Regular expression support for -v option. If large number of volumes are present in the cluster, filtering is easier.
* The default view now shows volume information as well.
* Much richer json output, this includes snapshot, volume health, brick process information, brick mount options and lot more.

## Why rewrite?

The earlier version was not maintained for a long time and was outdated. Due to the bulky code base, adding new features like quota, snapshots, and new volume types was difficult and would slow down the tool. Another motivation to rewrite gstatus is to leverage the flexibility and robustness of [glustercli-python](https://github.com/gluster/glustercli-python) library written by Aravinda and get away with gluster command execution, xml parsing, exception handling routines implemented within gstatus. All the heavy lifting is now done by the [glustercli-python](https://github.com/gluster/glustercli-python) library thus making gstatus faster, easily maintainable, and lightweight (gstatus is now ~200 lines of python program as compared to ~2500 lines in the earlier versions).


## A brief tour of gstatus

### Installing from source

* Installing glustercli-python

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/gluster/glustercli-python.git
$ cd glustercli-python
# python3 setup.py install
```

* Installing the gstatus tool
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/gluster/gstatus.git
$ cd gstatus
$ VERSION=1.0.1 make gen-version
# python3 setup.py install
```

### Using the pre-compiled binary
```console
$ curl -LO https://github.com/gluster/gstatus/releases/download/v1.0.1/gstatus
$ chmod +x ./gstatus
# cp gstatus /usr/local/bin
```

### Running gstatus

```console
# root@master-node:~# gstatus --help
Usage: gstatus [options]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --volume          Supply a volume or a list of volumes by repeated
                        invocation of -v. A regular expression can be provided
                        in place of a volume name (ensure to use single quotes
                        around the expression)
  -a, --all             Print all available details on volumes
  -b, --bricks          Print the list of bricks
  -q, --quota           Print the quota information
  -s, --snapshots       Print the snapshot information
  -u UNITS, --units=UNITS
                        display storage size in given units
  -o OUTPUT_MODE, --output-mode=OUTPUT_MODE
                        Output mode, only json is supported currently. Default
                        is to print to console.

## What's next?
Currently gstatus does not have self-heal information. In the next release we plan to add self-heal information like number of files pending heal.
