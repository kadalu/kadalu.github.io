At [Kadalu.io](https://kadalu.io), we reviewed the existing projects around [GlusterFS](https://gluster.org) and identified a few projects which can help the users to manage/monitor GlusterFS clusters. [Gdash](https://github.com/kadalu/gdash) is one such project that provides a lightweight solution to monitor the GlusterFS. This project is now moved from my repo to [Github/Kadalu](https://github.com/kadalu) organization.

Read [this blog](https://aravindavk.in/blog/introducing-gdash/) for the initial announcement of this project.

This release got a nice UI upgrade and a few more features. Highlights of the new features are:

* Gdash now uses glustercli Python bindings from the project [gluster/glustercli-python](https://github.com/gluster/glustercli-python)
* The improved User interface.
* The earlier version used the `--remote-host` option to execute volume info and status commands. But this option only allowed on a few read-only commands. This version of gdash runs within the Cluster, which means run it on any one node of the Cluster.
* One of the issues with GlusterFS CLI is hostname is shown as localhost in the node where the command is executed(`gluster pool list`). Gdash adds a hostname argument so that it replaces the localhost with the provided hostname.
* Login is supported, and it is very easy to configure.
